<hr />

This paper identifies MiRNAs within rat and human stool samples. This is one of the first studies to analyze miRNAs within fecal samples.

</div>
<div class="csl-left-margin">Introduction: (I'm defining MiRNA here so I can look up the definition later) MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs, averaging 18-23 nucleotides in length, that function within the cytoplasm of cells. This pilot study was done to investigate the existence of functional miRNAs within areas of the gut and fecal samples.</div>

<div class="csl-left-margin">Methods: Human and mice fecal samples (for mice samples were also collected in different areas of the host's gut) were collected and profiled for 566 mouse and 800 human miRNAs using a Nanostring Ncounter analysis platform. Comparisons were made between:</div>
<ul>
	<li class="csl-left-margin">The top 50 abundant miRNAs between the mouse and human fecal samples.</li>
	<li class="csl-left-margin">Student's t-test with the appropriate corrections were used between the mice samples among the variable spatial sites and germ free and colonized fecal matter.</li>
	<li class="csl-left-margin">Principal Components Analysis was used comparing the spatial gut samples in mice and the GF and colonized fecal content.</li>
</ul>
