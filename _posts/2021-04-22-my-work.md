## Developing the FQM Mapper: Enhancing Data Quality at the U.S. Census Bureau

During my time at the U.S. Census Bureau as a Data Scientist, I spearheaded the development of the Field Quality Monitoring (FQM) Mapper, an ArcGIS Online-based mapping and analysis dashboard.  This tool was designed to enhance the FQM program by providing near-real-time identification and corrective action of potential data issues in survey field data collection.    

The FQM Mapper offers a range of functionalities, including:

- Visualizing the distribution of field data across different regions.    
- Identifying statistical outliers and potential anomalies.    
- Monitoring key performance indicators.    
- Facilitating data-driven decision-making for improved data quality.    

This project involved collaborating with personnel focused on data engineering to develop schemas and tables for metrics calculations.  The Census Bureau's Unified Tracking System's (UTS) data warehouse was used to extract, transform, and load tables for metrics calculations.    

I led the development of coding solutions for outlier and anomaly detection for Field Representatives and Field Supervisor Areas using AHS INR data.  My research and utilization of novel coding methodologies using Python and R were integrated within the U.S. Census Bureau survey database infrastructure.    

Extensive documentation of outlier/anomaly detection and metric development in Jupyter Notebooks provided a clear and robust work trail from data extraction, transformation, analysis, and visualization.    

The development and implementation of the FQM Mapper significantly improved the efficiency and effectiveness of the FQM program, enabling better monitoring, analysis, and reporting capabilities. It also supported informed decision-making and process improvements in data collection operations. 

## One Health, GPAWSS and Machine Learning Integration

While I was at the US Army Public Health Center, working as a Epidemiologist, I gave two presentations detailing the data processing and limitations for companion animal surveillance within the Department of Defense.
GPAWSS is a surveillance platform designed to provide surveillance data to inform commanders and VCOs of the distribution, frequency, and incidence of various companion animal diseases. The platform uses multiple heterogeneous data streams including: Remote Online Veternary Record (ROVR) EHR data, laboratory data, and data from a civilian corporate companion animal practice. Data in GPAWSS is managed by the One-Health Division and is displayed on an interactive, web-based platform (Tableau and R-Shiny) tracking disease frequency and incidence globally. GPAWSS also has outbreak detection capabilities.

One presentation detailed the pitfalls of utilizing Master Problem Lists as the main effort of companion animal disease surveillance and what can be used to "fill in the blanks" or "drain the sea of uncertainty".

The second presentation dealt the Integration of high-performance computing and machine learning within the Army Veterinary Service in order to improve Surveillance of Companion Animal Disease within the Department of Defense. This presentation was part of the Association of Veterinary Infromatics Talbot Symposium 2020.
