Welcome to my Professional Site!

I am a newly minted PhD in the Department of Epidemiology, located at the University of Florida, in Gainesville, FL. I currently work for Dr. Jason Blackburn's  Spatial Epidemiology &amp; Ecology Research Laboratory (SEER Lab). An interdisciplinary laboratory jointly housed in the Emerging Pathogens Institute and the Department of Geography at the University of Florida.

Myself, my great wife Holly and my awesome dogs D.W. and Barnaby have been living in Gainesville recently married in November 2017.

I've resided in Gainesville since 2007 and been a part of the United States Army Reserve since 2011 with the 842nd Signal Company, located in Milton Florida.
