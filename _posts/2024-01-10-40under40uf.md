**About Dr. Sheldon Waugh:**

Dr. Sheldon Waugh is a highly accomplished individual with a diverse background encompassing public service, data science, and epidemiology.  He has dedicated his career to leveraging data for the betterment of society, showcasing his unwavering commitment to public service and innovation.    

He has made significant contributions to the field of data science throughout his career. As a Lead Data Scientist at the U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of Inspector General (DOC OIG), he spearheaded data-driven projects that yielded informed projections, well-substantiated decisions, and impactful recommendations based on meticulous audits and investigations.  His leadership extended to the development and maintenance of an ArcGIS Online-based mapping and analysis dashboard, a tool that effectively tracked broadband availability and progress.  This dashboard significantly supported the DOC OIG's mission to ensure the efficient and effective deployment of broadband infrastructure.    

Dr. Waugh's expertise in data science is further evidenced by his involvement in cross-agency initiatives, including the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee (PRAC) analytics and data-sharing pilot.  His collaborative efforts with external AI partners and open sources facilitated the successful integration of high-level machine learning technologies and methods.  Moreover, he played a pivotal role in the development and implementation of advanced scripts for data collection and processing, demonstrating his proficiency in web scraping, API usage, and geospatial metadata management.    

His commitment to data-driven solutions led him to create data etiquette guidelines for the DOC OIG, establishing best practices for curating data from server-based databases.  He also championed the use of natural language processing and generative AI to analyze grant documentation, identify potential pass-through schemes, and summarize extensive state broadband deployment documents.    

Prior to his role at the DOC OIG, Dr. Waugh served as a data scientist at the U.S. Census Bureau.  His contributions there were equally impactful, including leading an audio-related natural language processing project and establishing front-facing ESRI Mapper dashboards and tools for the American Housing Survey (AHS) and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS).  He also spearheaded the development of Tableau dashboards for the AHS and served as the senior administrator of the OSCA Tableau Server.    

Dr. Waugh's dedication to public service extends beyond his data science roles. He served as an epidemiologist at the U.S. Army Public Health Center, where he focused on the epidemiology and surveillance of military and beneficiary animal populations.  His contributions in this role include serving on the APHC COVID-19 Task Force Team, which was instrumental in developing a searchable COVID-19 knowledge management system.    

In addition to his civilian career, Dr. Waugh is a Major in the U.S. Army Reserves, serving as the Chief Brigade Communications Chief for the 302D Maneuver Enhancement Brigade.  He is responsible for the cybersecurity and command systems integration for a large contingent of soldiers and has contributed to critical operations such as Operation Allies Welcome.    

Dr. Waugh's exceptional contributions have been recognized through numerous awards and accolades. He is a recipient of the U.S. Census Director's Award for Innovation, the Department of Commerce's Bronze Award, and the Army Medicine Annual Wolf Pack Award.  His commitment to excellence and his passion for using data for good have solidified his reputation as a leader in his field.
