## One Health, GPAWSS and Machine Learning Integration

While I was at the US Army Public Health Center, working as a Epidemiologist, I gave two presentations detailing the data processing and limitations for companion animal surveillance within the Department of Defense.
GPAWSS is a surveillance platform designed to provide surveillance data to inform commanders and VCOs of the distribution, frequency, and incidence of various companion animal diseases. The platform uses multiple heterogeneous data streams including: Remote Online Veternary Record (ROVR) EHR data, laboratory data, and data from a civilian corporate companion animal practice. Data in GPAWSS is managed by the One-Health Division and is displayed on an interactive, web-based platform (Tableau and R-Shiny) tracking disease frequency and incidence globally. GPAWSS also has outbreak detection capabilities.

One presentation detailed the pitfalls of utilizing Master Problem Lists as the main effort of companion animal disease surveillance and what can be used to "fill in the blanks" or "drain the sea of uncertainty".

The second presentation dealt the Integration of high-performance computing and machine learning within the Army Veterinary Service in order to improve Surveillance of Companion Animal Disease within the Department of Defense. This presentation was part of the Association of Veterinary Infromatics Talbot Symposium 2020.
