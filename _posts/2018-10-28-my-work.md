I gave two presentations detailing the data processing and limitations for Companion animal surveillance within the Department of Defense.
GPAWSS is a surveillance platform designed to provide surveillance data to inform commanders and VCOs of the distribution, frequency, and incidence of various companion animal diseases. The platform uses multiple heterogeneous data streams including: Remote Online Veternary Record (ROVR) EHR data, laboratory data, and data from a civilian corporate companion animal practice. Data in GPAWSS is managed by the One-Health Division and is displayed on an interactive, web-based platform (Tableau and R-Shiny) tracking disease frequency and incidence globally. GPAWSS also has outbreak detection capabilities.
